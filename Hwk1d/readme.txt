Homework 1.D
Ben Matern

I use runProgram.sh to compile and run my program.  It's using g++ on a macbook.  

Input file name can be passed in as a parameter, like this:
./BenMaternHwk1 bens_image.txt


If there is no parameter passed, the program defaults to run some demos.
For this homework, parameterless will just generate the textures that I'm using.  

I only have 1 scene prepared for this assignment.

PROBLEMS:  
I gotta cry uncle on this one.  Assignment is way late by now, but I've just been chugging away, fixing bugs, learning, and figuring things out.  

No worries if you can't give me any points for it.  It's such a fun project that i needed to finish it regardless.  

This is how far I got.  I belive that reflection and transmission of light is working.  My scene shows reflective spheres, as well as transparent ones.  


Depth of view and soft shadows were not implemented.
