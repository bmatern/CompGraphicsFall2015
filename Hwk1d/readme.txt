Homework 1.D
Ben Matern

I use runProgram.sh to compile and run my program.  It's using g++ on a macbook.  

Input file name can be passed in as a parameter, like this:
./BenMaternHwk1 bens_image.txt


If there is no parameter passed, the program defaults to run some demos.
For this homework, parameterless will just generate the textures that I'm using.  

I only have 1 scene prepared for this assignment.

PROBLEMS:  


This is how far I got.  I belive that reflection and transmission of light is working.  My scene shows reflective spheres, as well as transparent ones.  


Depth of view and soft shadows were not implemented.
